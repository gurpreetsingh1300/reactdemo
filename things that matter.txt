a.State is an initial value set for a component, which is used for interactivity.



    States are mutable and only used on top level component

    They are reserved only for interactivity and component's event handlers may change to trigger a UI update

    State will be set with a default value when component mounts and will mutate in time based on user events generated
	
b. Props allows you to pass data from parent component to the child component.

Props are immutable - a component cannot change its props however it is responsible for putting together.


3. Stateless/Functional Component VS Stateful/Class Component

a. Stateless/Functional Component:

    It contains only props

    It is used to render data of a component


b. Stateful/Class Component :

    It has both props and states

    It encapsulates interaction logic as well as renders data
	
c. Tip: While developing an app, create several stateless components that renders data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to its children via props.
